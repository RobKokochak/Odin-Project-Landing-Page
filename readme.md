This is a challenge project from The Odin Project, which can be found here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page

I'm using it to practice some principles of front-end web design, including responsive techniques using flexbox and media queries. The project gives you a photo of the finished product, and asks you to build it from scratch using strictly html and css.

It's available to view in Environments/github-pages.
